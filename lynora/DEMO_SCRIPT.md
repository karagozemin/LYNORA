# LYNORA Demo Script

This script will guide you through recording a compelling demo video for the Linera Buildathon submission.

## Demo Duration: 2-3 minutes

## Scene 1: Introduction (15 seconds)

**Show**: Landing page with LYNORA logo

**Say**:
> "Hi! I'm excited to show you LYNORA - a real-time prediction market platform built on Linera blockchain. LYNORA leverages Linera's microchain architecture to deliver instant, scalable, and decentralized prediction markets."

## Scene 2: The Problem (15 seconds)

**Show**: Quick comparison slide or animation

**Say**:
> "Traditional prediction markets suffer from congestion, high gas fees, and slow transaction times. LYNORA solves this by giving each user their own microchain, enabling parallel execution and instant finality."

## Scene 3: Creating a Market (30 seconds)

**Show**: Screen recording of creating a market

**Actions**:
1. Click "Create Market"
2. Enter question: "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by end of month?"
3. Add description
4. Set duration: 7 days
5. Click "Create Market"
6. Show transaction confirmation

**Say**:
> "Creating a market is simple. I'll create a Bitcoin price prediction market. Each market runs on the creator's microchain - this means no global bottlenecks. The transaction confirms instantly thanks to Linera's architecture."

## Scene 4: Browsing Markets (20 seconds)

**Show**: Homepage with multiple markets

**Actions**:
1. Scroll through market cards
2. Show pool distribution
3. Hover over different markets

**Say**:
> "Users can browse all active markets across different microchains. See the real-time pool distribution? That updates instantly as bets are placed. This is the power of Linera's real-time capabilities."

## Scene 5: Placing a Bet (30 seconds)

**Show**: Market detail page and betting flow

**Actions**:
1. Open a market
2. Click "Bet UP"
3. Enter amount: 50 LYNORA
4. Confirm bet
5. Show instant update in pool distribution

**Say**:
> "Let me place a bet. I think Bitcoin will go UP. I enter my amount, confirm, and watch - the pool updates immediately. No waiting, no gas wars. This is possible because each transaction executes on my microchain in parallel with others."

## Scene 6: Real-Time Updates (20 seconds)

**Show**: Split screen or quick cuts showing multiple bets updating

**Actions**:
1. Show market with current stats
2. Simulate another bet (or show in another window)
3. Watch pools update in real-time

**Say**:
> "Watch what happens when other users bet. The pools update in real-time across all microchains. This demonstrates Linera's cross-chain queries and real-time synchronization."

## Scene 7: My Markets Dashboard (15 seconds)

**Show**: My Markets page

**Actions**:
1. Show "Markets I Created"
2. Show "Markets I Bet On" with position details

**Say**:
> "The dashboard shows all my markets and active positions. I can track everything in one place, with real-time updates on my potential winnings."

## Scene 8: Technical Highlights (20 seconds)

**Show**: Quick slides or code snippets (optional)

**Say**:
> "Under the hood, LYNORA uses Linera's GraphQL API for queries, microchains for parallel execution, and autonomous smart contracts for market resolution. Every user has their own microchain, eliminating global state bottlenecks."

## Scene 9: Future Vision (15 seconds)

**Show**: Roadmap slide or closing shot

**Say**:
> "This is just the beginning. Future plans include AI agent integration for automated trading, advanced oracles, and more complex market types. LYNORA proves that prediction markets can be truly real-time and scalable."

## Scene 10: Call to Action (10 seconds)

**Show**: GitHub repo and deployment links

**Say**:
> "LYNORA is live on Testnet Conway. Check out the links in the description to try it yourself. Thanks for watching!"
